# Nick Laws

Owner of [Laws Electrical Services](https://lawselecservices.com) in Brisbane. Building AI-powered automations for trade businesses — integrating Claude Code with field service tools like AroFlo and Xero to eliminate repetitive admin work.

## What I'm Building

Most AI content focuses on knowledge work. I'm documenting what it looks like when you bring it to a team of sparkies.

## The Bigger Picture

The electrical business is the prototype. The long-term vision is a permanent equity holding company where AI-powered systems make small trade businesses more efficient, more profitable, and better places to work.
